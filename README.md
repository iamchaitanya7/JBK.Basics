## Introduction

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is widely used in various domains, from web development to mobile applications. This repository is designed to help you understand and implement key Java concepts through practical examples and exercises.

## Core Java Concepts

This section covers the fundamental concepts of Java that every Java developer should know:

- **Variables and Data Types:** Understanding primitive and non-primitive data types.
- **Control Flow Statements:** If-else, loops, and switch-case statements.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Exception Handling:** Try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, and best practices.
- **Collections Framework:** Lists, sets, maps, queues, and their implementations.
- **Streams & Lambdas:** Introduction to functional programming in Java.
- **File Handling:** Reading and writing files in Java.
- **Multithreading:** Creating and managing threads, thread synchronization.

## Advanced Java Concepts

This section dives deeper into more advanced topics, including:

- **Java Servlets:** Building dynamic web applications with servlets.
- **JSP (JavaServer Pages):** Simplifying the creation of dynamic web content.
- **Spring Framework:** Dependency Injection, Spring Boot, RESTful APIs.
- **Hibernate:** Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with Hibernate.
- **Microservices:** Building and managing microservices in Java.
- **Design Patterns:** Common design patterns in Java and their implementation.
- **JDBC:** Database connectivity with Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).
- **Security:** Secure coding practices, JWT, OAuth, and other security protocols.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Install the latest version of JDK from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.
- **IDE:** You can use any Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans. Alternatively, you can use a simple text editor like VS Code along with the Java extension.
- **Maven/Gradle:** Optional but recommended for managing dependencies in larger projects.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamchaitanya7/JBK.Basics.git
   cd JBK.Basics
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment:**

(Optional) Set up Maven or Gradle if you plan to use them.
Run Your First Program: Navigate to the desired directory and compile a Java program:

3. **Run Your First Program: Navigate to the desired directory and compile a Java program:**

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

## Usage
This repository is organized into folders by topic. Each folder contains Java programs with relevant concepts:

- **/core-java: Contains basic Java programs and concepts.**
- **/advanced-java: Contains advanced Java topics and implementation.**
- **/projects: Contains mini-projects demonstrating the use of multiple concepts together.**
- **/examples: Practical examples and exercises.**
